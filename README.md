# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely delivery crucial because it keeps the project on schedule.
PMs ensures that deadlines are met by : Ensure thatthe team understands the deadline,scope and the expected deliverables,Selecting the correct methodology for the project,have clearly defined KPIs, flagging risks correctly, having review meetings to check progress and having the right resources and good number of resources working on the project.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Effective cost control  helps identify areas of excessive spending, inefficiencies, and waste.
Strategies:
 Conduct thorough research and analysis during project planning.
 Involve key stakeholders in the estimation process for diverse  perspectives.
 Establish a collaborative approach within the project team to  enhance accuracy.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile involves iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development while waterfall involves Linear and sequential approach.
Agile emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback while waterfall emphasizes each phase must be completed before the next begins.

Agile:
Advantages:
- Quick response to changes.
- Regular customer feedback.
- Improved team collaboration.
Disadvantages:
- Less predictability.
- Requires significant customer involvement.

Waterfall:
Advantages:
- Clear structure and documentation.
- Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
Disadvantages:
- Difficult to accommodate changes.
- Testing occurs late in the process.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile: Product design projects  e.g  developing a new website
Waterfall for Bigger projects  e.g. Health projects
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Methods:
Define the scope and goals
Plan the QA activities
Review of the requirements,Codes
System Walkthorughs
Implement the QA process
Evaluate the QA outcomes
Improve the QA process 
Evaluating the QA outcomes regularly 

Maintaing high stanadard:
Ensures that the project deliverables meet the required standards and satisfy customer expectations.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining scope enables the team to hit the project goals and objectives without delay or overwork.
WBS is a project management system that breaks projects into smaller, more manageable components or tasks.It is a visual tool that breaks down the entire project to make it easier to plan, organize, and track progress
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Benefits:
    Ensures that everything comes from the project schedule.
    Taska are well Prioritized
    Establishes a project timeline. 
    Monitors team performance(Resource management).
    Simplifies the project management process.
    Ensures consistency.
    Promotes best practices(Risk management).
    Leads to Stakeholder satisfaction

  Gantt charts assists to identifies tasks that may be executed in parallel and those that can't be started or finished until others are complete.Therefore,helps detect    potential bottlenecks and identify tasks that may have been excluded from the project timeline.

  
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
Core issues:
The software aims at providing the best self-tried recipes  vetted with the very best chefs in the world.
 Real attention to quality-To ensure that the target audience does not run on blocking issues when using the system
 Ever-Changing Software Requirements-To ensure that new requirements are taken in an agreeable way to incooperate the target audience needs.
 Security-To ensure that the malware are well detected and easily removed if encountered to ensure that the data of target audidence is safe.

 
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
The system aims in providing a high quality software that enables the users submit additional requirments to the analyst for review,approval and submisiion to development team whilst ensuring that security is not compromised.Currently,only a few chef have an idea of what other recipes taste like in their locality.This system will reduce tha to 5% by providing on eplateform that allows chefs see recipes ,try,taste and give feedbacks allowing our target audiences use the reviews for improvemnts in there area/providing new recipes. 


## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
 Software solution will giveaccess of multiple recipes,tried and tested plus vitual guide and Q & A session on request.

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Quick sign up steps
Two validation/authentication steps makinf it safest
4 hours response on request for one on one Q & A session with the best chefs 
Virtual view of how your end recipes will look like

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Currently the market size is 30% in the major cities and the system projects a potential growth of 69% in the major countries and target 10% in the small cities.
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Understanding market trends confirms if ite the opportune time for your software to de developed and released. The trend on the targeteed market behaviour,technological advancements and regulatory changes will define if we proceed or wait.
